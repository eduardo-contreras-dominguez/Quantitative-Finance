    "We observe that for same credit rating, banks have a much higher Z-Spread that non-banking industries.Indeed, __banks bonds may trade differently from non-banks bonds for several reasons, including differences in credit risk, regulatory requirements, and market liquidity.__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Credit risk: Banks are considered riskier than non-banks because of their exposure to credit risk from lending and investment activities. As a result, banks' bonds may trade at a higher yield or lower price compared to non-bank bonds with similar credit ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regulatory requirements: Banks are subject to stricter regulatory requirements than non-banks, which can impact the trading of their bonds. For example, regulatory requirements may require banks to hold more capital or limit their ability to issue debt, which can affect their ability to pay back their bondholders. These factors may also affect the demand and supply of bank bonds, which can affect their prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Market liquidity: Banks' bonds may have lower trading volumes and less market liquidity compared to non-bank bonds due to their higher credit risk and regulatory requirements. This can make it more difficult for investors to buy or sell bank bonds, and can lead to wider bid-ask spreads and higher transaction costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while there may be some similarities in the trading of bank and non-bank bonds, the differences in credit risk, regulatory requirements, and market liquidity can result in different pricing and trading patterns for these two types of bonds."
